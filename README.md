# Text Wallpaper

Hi <img width="24" alt="hi-hello" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9bc7976-5228-46e1-a7b2-087245386370">

I made this neat little tool to get more experience with Swift, it gives you some configuration options and generates a nice looking text filled wallpaper for you. I honestly don't want to work anymore on this since it wasn't very fun for me, but, it's still kind of cool, so here it is!
